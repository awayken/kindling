# Install Kindling #

Kindling is as easy to use as downloading it, moving it into your webroot, and browsing the website. A successful install should result in a webpage that displays "Welcome to Kindling." An unsuccessful install might result in swearing and frustration.

The trunk includes a framework folder, which contains Kindling, and a plugins folder, which contains plugins. If you create your own plugins, feel free to submit those to the project.
