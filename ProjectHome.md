**Kindling** is a ColdFusion framework that aims to make it easy for developers to get a new site up-and-running. It comes from the philosophy that website content is the kindling. The more you can concentrate on it, the better your campfire will be. Kindling is not a content management system; it's a template and plugin system. It's configurable, it's flexible, and it's simple.

Kindling works in:
  * Adobe ColdFusion 8, 9
  * Railo 3.2
  * Open BlueDragon 1.4
